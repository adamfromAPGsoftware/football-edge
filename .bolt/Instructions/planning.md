# High-Level Planning for the Bolt.New App

## Overview
The Bolt.New app is a mobile-first application designed to enhance the training experience for soccer/football enthusiasts. It provides a comprehensive onboarding process, a personalized dashboard, and various interactive features to engage users in their training journey.

## Features

### Onboarding Process
- **Sign In/Sign Up**: Users can sign up and go through a 9-step onboarding process.
  - **Question 1**: Where did you hear about us?
  - **Question 2**: Select 2 positions that you play in (from typical soccer/football positions, ideally on an actual pitch).
  - **Question 3**: Physical Profile (Height, weight, age).
  - **Question 4**: Preferred foot (Left/Right/Both).
  - **Question 5**: Training Goal (Amateur, Semi-Pro, Pro).
